# DashIQ — Missing Value Report

## Dataset
sales_records.csv

## Objective
To identify incomplete records and assess whether missing values exist in the raw dataset.

## Missing Value Check Summary

### 1. Null Column Check
A missing value scan was performed across all columns using Pandas.

### 2. Missing Value Count
Initial inspection found the following:

- Columns with missing values: 0
- Total missing values: 0

### 3. Missing Value Percentage
Missing value percentages were calculated to assess data completeness.

### 4. Handling Strategy
Based on the inspection:

- If no missing values were found:
  - No action required
  - Dataset can proceed to the next cleaning stage

- If missing values were found:
  - Low-impact rows may be removed
  - Non-critical categorical values may be filled with "Unknown"
  - Numeric/date fields require review before imputation

## Initial Conclusion
The dataset is [clean / requires minor handling / requires data cleaning] in terms of missing values.
